# Boxing management tournament

### Description

This is a boxing tournament using OOP principles and some novice unit testing.
This is going to be a 16 bracket "knock-out style tournament". Later on I might improve into
the best out of 3 or 5 style. This will be for the 135 division. I will be using real
dimension of fighters, new; and when they were in their prime if
I pick a retired fighter or a fighter that upped in weight class.

This project automates the tournament process based on the matches of each fighter.
The match of each fighter is going to be based on a 50/50 probability. 
Further features may introduce a more sophisticated probability system.
