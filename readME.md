# Boxing management tournament

### Description

This is a boxing tournament using OOP principles and some novice unit testing.
This is going to be a 16 bracket "knock-out style tournament". Later on I might improve into
the best out of 3 or 5 style. This will be for the 135 division. I will be using real
dimension of fighters, new; and when they were in their prime if
I pick a retired fighter or a fighter that upped in weight class.
