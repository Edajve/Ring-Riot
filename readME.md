# Boxing management tournament

### Description

This is a boxing tournament using OOP principles and some novice unit testing.
This is going to be a 16 bracket "knock-out style tournament". Later on I might improve into
the best out of 3 or 5 style. This will be for the 135 division. I will be using real
dimension of fighters, new; and when they were in their prime if
I pick a retired fighter or a fighter that upped in weight class.

This project automates the tournament process based on the matches of each fighter.
Every match, there will be three judges that will score the fights, and their scorecards will be summed
to determine who is the winner.
The match of each fighter is going to be based on a 50/50 probability. 
Further features may introduce a more sophisticated probability system.

During the program, im going to have the stats of each fight and the tournmanet written to a text file so that the logs can
see what happended during the tournament, and who beat who.
